## MQTT Module

MQTT is mostly found in use on custom implementations. If you use this module to control a device or software on the market that more than you are using, <strong>PLEASE let us know</strong> about this software, so we can make a proper module for it. If we already support a device and you use this to trigger a feature our module doesn't support, please let us know. We want Companion to be as easy as possible to use.
